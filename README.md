In the name of God, the Beneficent and the Merciful.

Wanderlust is a set of programs that will help analyze and track individuals who came in contact with COVID-19 affectees by looking at their location history to provide social distancing alerts. It provides a solution for societies where people are less educated and less tech-oriented. Wanderlust uses WhatsApp-based and a camera/CCTV-based solution for location tracking of individuals. It makes sure that exact and right numbers are predicted so that people could be guided at the right time to quarantine themselves to curb the further spread of the disease.
